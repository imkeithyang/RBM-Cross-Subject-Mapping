# Cross Subject Mapping Via Fisher RBM

Codebase for our paper: Cross-subject Mapping of Neural Activity with Restricted Boltzmann Machines. We map different subject's distribution based on conditional distribution represented by the Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM. 

We also propose the novel training of RBM using Fisher Divergence with explicit gradient computation.
